# Asteroids

i never implemented lives; if you die it fully restarts

some things have sounds and some don't

also sounds are ripped straight from half-life (and are very loud)

the directory is called 2dcameratest which just goes to show how little of an idea what i was going to do with this when i started

the code is shit, you'd be better off writing your own.

jarfile in releases probably

# Controls

 LMB - toggle debug (i know it's awful)
 W, A, D - movement and turning
 SPACE - shoot
that's it
