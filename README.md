# Asteroids

i never implemented lives; if you die it fully restarts

also sounds are ripped straight from half-life (and are very loud)

the directory is called 2dcameratest which just goes to show how little of an idea what i was going to do with this when i started

the code is shit, you'd be better off writing your own.

jarfile in releases probably... and it's probably outdated compared to the code too

# Changelog

- v1.03
  - added a tribute to doom but its with a counter-strike death sound
  - sort of refactored the codebase
  - renamed some things and added more comments

# Controls

 Q - toggle debug (not LMB anymore)
 
 W, A, D - movement and turning
 
 SPACE - shoot
 
that's it (maybe more coming soon)
